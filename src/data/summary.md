I aim to develop software systems that have a very large number of users. Users of my software can be a regular user or a tech-savy developer. 
My theme of developement is going beyond the API calls, understand the underlying software stack, and write modular and highly scalable code. 

I am passionate about developing software systems that is usable to large number of users and developers.
My work spans across the tech stack, from user applications to OS kernels, focusing on understanding the layers beneath APIs to create modular, efficient code.
Recently, I completed Masters in Computer Science from Syracuse University in New York. During my master I researched security of smart home systems and networking subsystem of Linux kernel. Before Syracuse University, I worked as mobile application developer (iOS and Android) at Samsung Research.

[I pursued a double degree in computer science and business](/#education), [interned at big tech companies in Silicon Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-LJ2e5qKdE), and [competed in over 21 hackathons for fun](/#hackathons). I also had the pleasure of being a part of the first ever in-person cohort of buildspace called [buildspace sf1](https://buildspace.so/sf1).
